<p> Beautiful is better than ugly. <br/>
Explicit is better than implicit.  <br/>
Simple is better than complex.  <br/>
Complex is better than complicated.  <br/>
Flat is better than nested.  <br/>
Sparse is better than dense.  <br/>
Readability counts.  <br/>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  <br/>
Although practicality beats purity.  <br/>
Errors should never pass silently.  <br/>
Unless explicitly silenced.  <br/>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  <br/>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  <br/>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  <br/>
Now is better than never.  <br/>
Although never is often better than *right* now.  <br/>
